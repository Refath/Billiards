# Billiards
The Triangular Billiards Problem (TBP) is an open problem which asks if all triangles have periodic orbits. 
I have been steadily working on this problem for the better part of 2022. Here is a timeline of major developments: 

- January 25, 2022: First Simulation of TBP, implemented using iterated Newton's Laws
- March 5, 2022: Second Simulation of TBP, implemented using parametric equations
- September 30, 2022: LSTM Neural Network of TBP, trained using second simulation
