# Billiards
The Triangular Billiards Problem (TBP) is an open problem which asks if all triangles have periodic orbits. 
I have been steadily working on this problem for the better part of 2022. Here is a timeline of major developments: 

- **January 25, 2022**: First Simulation of TBP, implemented using iterated Newton's Laws
- **March 5, 2022**: Second Simulation of TBP, implemented using parametric equations
- **September 30, 2022**: LSTM Neural Network of TBP, trained using second simulation

The first simulation may be accessed here: [**TBP Simulation #1**](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Refath/Billiards/HEAD?urlpath=tree). It takes a considerable time to load (except ~4 minutes), in part due to the packages that must be downloaded. If memory failure, please run in an incognito (i.e., private) window.
